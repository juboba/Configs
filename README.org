* Personal Configuration

This is my personal configuration. It's currently a mess in progress.

** OS Config
Since I use NixOS, my OS config is managed by [[./nixos/configuration.nix][configuration.nix]].

** User Config
I'm currently migrating all of my configurations to [[./nixpkgs/home.nix][home.nix]] by using
[[https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager][home-manager]] since it's easily reproduce-able and I can have everything in the
same format and place.

My config is mainly:
- Packages to install
- Shell aliases
- Various dotfiles
- Overlays to further customize packages

** Editor Config
I have two configuration directories under ~emacs~, but I'm no longer
using Spacemacs. I fully recommend Spacemacs, but it has lots of things I don't use
and felt more attracted to Doom Emacs since much more lightweight yet
still powerful enough.

** TODOs
**** TODO Arrange ~/Scripts and move what's necessary to ~scripts~
I also have lots of not-so-taken-care-of scripts that I use less frequently but
are also worth having. So! I should clean them up, move what's necessary to
~/.bin and remove what's not necessary anymore.
**** TODO Check what the hell is going on with emacs and sqlite3
This is not too important so I haven't done it, but in order to use ~magit
forge~ I need to have ~sqlite3~ available for Emacs (in the ~load-path~). I'm
currently using a ~PATH~ directly pointing to a derivation in the ~/store~ so
that Emacs picks it up, but I don't know if that's necessary anymore since I'm
installing emacs with:

#+begin_src nix
    (emacsWithPackages (epkgs: [ epkgs.emacsql-sqlite ]))
#+end_src
